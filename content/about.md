# About

I'm an AI Researcher from Cork, Ireland, based in London, UK. My background is in statistics and data science, spanning a wide range of application areas. This ability to follow your curiosity and work in completely different domains is what I love about data science. I did my [PhD](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/entities/publication/293607ca-eab5-4917-8f66-6d9a386c4205) on multi-modal machine learning for cyber security, but during that time I also got to work on projects in medicine, worked with Rolls Royce on jet engine analysis, founded a VC-backed [startup](https://shoji.ai) in data privacy, even wrote a [paper](http://siba-ese.unisalento.it/index.php/ejasa/article/view/16474) on a mathematical formula used in cricket! I think for the curious-minded, there's really no better field.[^1]

## Work

Following my PhD, I joined [Agemo](https://www.agemo.ai) as founding AI Research Scientist. My work there covered research, model training and applied engineering. I led LLM training initiatives, building synthetic data generation pipelines, designing evaluation suites, and scaling SFT and RLHF experiments all the way from LoRA fine-tuning on local hardware to distributed training across 64x H100 GPU clusters. I spearheaded a research project on the ARC-AGI challenge, developing a multi-stage pipeline that successfully generated solutions to 85% of training tasks using Claude. This work caught the attention of François Chollet, who joined as scientific advisor after we open-sourced our approach. I was also responsible for agent design in Agemo's core product, CodeWords, a platform for automated software generation. I worked on tool design, architecture, orchestration, context engineering, tracing and evals.

## Outside Work

Outside of work, I generally try to be on the water. I grew up sailing and, while London's lacking in sea, I try to make do with the River Thames. I have a dinghy that I race on the weekends, and I foolishly bought a 1984 speedboat on eBay for what I thought was a bargain.[^2] The ratio of time spent enjoying it to time spent trying to fix it is not good. But it keeps me busy! I'm also obsessed with perfecting my pizza dough; I have two pizza ovens and every accessory under the sun.

## About this Site

This website is built with [FastHTML](https://www.fastht.ml/), a Python web framework for fast, scalable web applications with minimal, compact code. With zero prior web development experience and total confusion about the various modern web frameworks, I was inspired to build it after reading the book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/). It describes a simpler approach to web development based on the fundamental ideas and technologies that empowered the early web. You can view the full source code for this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackhogan/personal-site).
