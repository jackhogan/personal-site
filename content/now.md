# Now

> This is a "Now page"—it details what I'm focused on **right now**, at this point in my life. For more details, see [https://nownownow.com/about](https://nownownow.com/about)

I recently left my role at Agemo after an amazing couple of years. I learned so much, had the freedom to work on cool projects and the resources to train LLMs and experiment with the latest techniques, but with so much happening in AI right now, I started to get an itch to try something new.

Rather than jumping straight into the next thing, I decided to take a couple of months to invest in myself—working on personal projects and diving deep into areas I'd been meaning to explore. Purely for fun, and because I was blown away by the book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/), I've been teaching myself web development. Starting very much at zero (*"Claude, please explain what CSS is"*), I've built this website entirely from scratch, in a web framework LLMs know very little about.

I've also used this opportunity to take part in the following two courses:

- [Scratch to Scale: Large-Scale Training in the Modern World](https://maven.com/walk-with-code/scratch-to-scale) by Zach Mueller from Hugging Face, on the art and science of parallelising LLM training across hundreds of GPUs. I spent a long time at Agemo figuring this out for myself, building up my training recipes, DeepSpeed configs and SLURM scripts from scattered tutorials, Discord discussions and random gists. I was amazed at how hard it was to find high-quality guidance online. So when I saw this course advertised and the expert panel of guest lecturers (from Meta, Anyscale, Unsloth, Axolotl, Prime Intellect), I knew it would be worth jumping on.

- [How to Solve it with Code](https://solve.it.com/) from Answer.AI. Ever since I stumbled across [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) in 2022, I've been a huge fan of Jeremy Howard: he's contrarian, impervious to fads and seemingly always ahead of the curve. In this course, Jeremy, Johno Whitaker and guests teach the extremely considered and intentional approach that they take when working with AI, be it for solving problems, building new products, writing prose or learning new material. It's a really fun course packed with invaluable insights about everything from web scraping to web development, sys admin to sasquatches.

I'm now turning my attention to new opportunities. If you're working on something interesting, I'd love to hear from you—LinkedIn, X and email are in the footer below.
